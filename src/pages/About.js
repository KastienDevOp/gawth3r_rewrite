              Yep! Gawth3r was once known as Buttlerbot. Buttlerbot came about
              back around the year 2019 with my best friend, Chris. We were chilln'
              one day and I was watching him program and found it to be quite interesting.
              I started asking questions, and what different things did plus I would name
              things and bet that he couldn't do it. Boy..he sure could, haha! I decided at
              that point that I wanted to learn how to do this. The first thing I had to
              decide on was, "What is something you can bring to the table that someone else
              already hasn't?" -Chris. I told him that I use discord and wondered if the bots
              were just simply premade, and you got them from the website or were they created
              by people like he and i? He replied that we could make one ourselves, so then the
              adventure began. To fast-forward a bit, though, he tried to get me to understand
              that mastering the basics was a very important building-block, but I refused to
              listen. After numerous hours of begging for help, pissing people off, getting pissed
              off, throwing my computer across the room....you get the point, I had finally
              started understanding the code and how it worked, but it was just with building a
              discord bot. Outside of the discord python library, I couldn't tell you, or show you, 
              how to do anything. However, I digress. After much struggle with trying to figure out 
              who and what I wanted my bot to be I decided I wanted to make him my own type of smart 
              assistant that worked within the discord platform. Multiple, Multiple repositories later,
              I switched gears and started working ButtlerBot from being a discord assistant to being 
              an at-home assistant like Alexa, Google, and Amazon. It was going alright for a while, but 
              then my work environment became corrupt and I just couldn't bring myself to re-construct
              the project. So then I took a break from coding, played some video games, and now we
              (Chris and I) are back to bring you the best platform available to any and all members
              within the discord community, and more.
